Icebreaker Xuelong to search for new environmental pollutants

The Chinese icebreaker Xuelong will set out for northern seas on Friday to continue its research of the Arctic Ocean's environment, ocean circulation patterns and natural resources.

For the first time, it will search for new environmental pollutants. Measuring ocean acidification and the spread of microplastics will continue to be major parts of the expedition this year - a planned 22,800-km voyage - after they were studied for the first time last year, scientists said during a media briefing on Thursday.

Ocean acidification is internationally acknowledged as worsening in the Arctic, mainly as a result of rising carbon dioxide emissions. Also, microplastics may trigger environmental disasters, such as the bleaching of coral reefs, and affect marine biodiversity, the scientists said.

"We achieved world-class research results last year in those two aspects and will continue to make efforts this time to address regional and global environmental issues," said Xia Limin, deputy head of the Chinese Arctic and Antarctic Administration.

The situation in the Arctic Ocean is undoubtedly better than that of the oceans adjacent to continents with dense populations, but it will deteriorate with global warming and the decrease of sea ice, the researchers said.

Marine microplastics are tiny pieces of plastic often used in such things as facial cleansers that pass through wastewater treatment plants and reach the ocean. Environmental experts said microplastics have been discovered in zooplankton and can eventually find their way to human stomachs if consumed by fish and other creatures higher up the food chain.

Environmental research, including the distribution of zooplankton in the Arctic, sedimentation of organic carbon and marine microorganisms and their gene resources, will be another key issue for the 131-member expedition team before it returns in September.

"The Arctic Ocean is an important marine channel for the Belt and Road Initiative, and the country has put forward green Belt and Road construction. Such observations and research will help provide higher-level scientific support for collective ecological protection," said Wei Zexun, chief scientist of the expedition team.

Studies on the interaction of sea, ice, air and ocean circulation - which all play a role in affecting the global climate system and its variations - will continue to be undertaken by the expedition with the ultimate goal of responding to climate change, Wei said.

"The ecosystem in the Arctic region is closely related to disastrous blizzards and sleet in China. So such studies will also be meaningful for the country's marine disaster prevention," he said.

破冰船雪龙号将会探寻新的环境污染源。

在星期五，这艘中国破冰船将会在北部海继续探索北极圈的海洋环境，海洋循环模式和自然资源。

星期四科学家在媒体上做了简述。它的第一步是探索新的环境污染源。测量海洋酸性和微小塑料的传播将会成功主要的目标，将在今年迅速完成。该项航行计划22000km。

科学家说，海洋酸性被全球性的了解是因为它有害于北极圈，通过造成二氧化碳含量升高。此外，微小塑料可能会引起环境问题，例如漂白珊瑚礁和影响海洋生物多样性。

中国北极和和管理部门部长夏利民说，去年我们完成了两个世界级的调查，我们会继续做出努力去探索根源和解决全球环境问题。

这位调查者说，北极海洋球的情况毫无疑问是比北极拥有庞大人口的周围地区好的，但是它会因为全球变暖和海冰减少而恶化。

海洋的微小塑料都是小颗粒的塑料，这些小的塑料经常是被用于洁面乳。这些东西通过废水处理工厂，最后到海洋中。环境专家说微型塑料已经在浮游生物里找到，最终能找到他们进入人类胃部的方式，如果它们被鱼吃了和被其他食物链更高的生物。

环境研究表示，在雪龙号七月回来之前，在北极浮游生物的分布，有机碳的沉淀和海洋微生物及其基因将会是131名成员的探索队的另一部分关键问题。

探索队的首席科学家魏泽勋说，北冰洋是一个非常重要的海上渠道对xxx（没看懂），
